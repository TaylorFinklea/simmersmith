# Decisions

This is a concise running ADR log. Add a new entry when a decision changes implementation direction, constraints, or sequencing.

## 2026-03-27 - Shared repo docs are the assistant handoff source of truth

- `docs/ai/roadmap.md`, `docs/ai/current-state.md`, and `docs/ai/next-steps.md` are the required session-start files.
- `docs/ai/current-state.md`, `docs/ai/next-steps.md`, and `docs/ai/decisions.md` are the required session-end update files.
- Chat memory is not the source of truth.

## 2026-03-27 - AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md follow the shared docs workflow

- Repo-level `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are aligned around the same `docs/ai` session-start and session-end workflow.
- Assistant-specific guidance stays in those files, but shared state must live in `docs/ai/*`.

## 2026-03-27 - Phase 1 AI recipe suggestions ship as draft-only and library-grounded first

- The first implementation of recipe suggestions is heuristic and grounded in saved recipes plus existing metadata.
- Suggestions open in the existing recipe editor as drafts and are never silently saved.
- This preserves the current MCP-first architecture while keeping the first slice small and testable.

## 2026-03-27 - Phase 2 companion suggestions are recipe-detail-only and return three standalone drafts

- Companion suggestions currently live only on the recipe detail screen, not the recipes list.
- The server returns exactly three draft options per request: a vegetable side, a starch side, and a sauce/drizzle.
- Companion results are standalone recipe drafts, not variants, and are never auto-saved.
- The first implementation is deterministic and cuisine-aware, matching the existing MCP-first but heuristic-first rollout style.
